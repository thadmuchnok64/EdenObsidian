Dialogue with [Ralphy]:

W: You picked the wrong day to throw your little tantrum.
W: I had to end my vacation in Purgatory early thanks to you. 
W: Now I have to find a ton of new vessels for my guards that you broke.
W: Look. Let me extend
R:  Just let me out of here! I'll come back and personally help you fix your guards.
W: Nope. You're actions today demonstrated that you're broken too. You need to be recycled.
W: Time to die.

After beating:

W: Damnit Rapheala, You ruined everything.
W:  So you beat me. Oh well. When I'm brought back, I'm coming after you.
W: I'm personally gonna drag you down to hell so you can spend eternity with your precious human.
W: In the meantime, here's a little goodbye gift.
