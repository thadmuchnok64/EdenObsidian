The fate of a soul depends on the purity or [[vald]] of a [[Soul]]. Souls with more vald raise to the top, where souls without sink to the bottom. They naturally separate like oil and water.

When a being enters the [[Afterlife]], they are [[Dormant]] until a great being gives them a [[Vessels|vessel]].
