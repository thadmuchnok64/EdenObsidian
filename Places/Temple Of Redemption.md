A place where Sinners can go to seek redemption, and access into [[Heaven]].

Located somewhere in [[Purgatory]], but is initially a mystery to the player.

[[Gael]] found this temple in one of his many journeys through purgatory. It started as a meeting place, but turned into a place where Azra could help souls seeking redemption. Azra brings the temple supplies so that the people there are sustained.
