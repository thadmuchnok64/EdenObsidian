A nation state within [[Purgatory]]. Formed after [[The Demon Wars]]. Halcyona is a very capitalistic and corrupt nation. The leader cares more about ascending to godhood than his own citizens.

Halcyona is unique because of its ability to give humans a purpose aside from seeking heaven or hell. Humans could live in purgatory in relative comfort instead of seeking to go to heaven.
