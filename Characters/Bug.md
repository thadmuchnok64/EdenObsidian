A small hellborn. He was too small to fight in [[The Demon Wars]], so he helped out by crafting and upgrading weapons for fellow demons. He adopted gunpowder late into the war, but it was too late.

[[Gael]] found him on his ventures to [[Hell]] and was pleasantly surprised at this demons attitude. Bug was convinced by him to join him at the temple of redemption in search of a better life.

Intro Convo

Ralphy is curious about why there's a demon here. She is suspicious of him.

Bug just wants to sell the bitch shit.

Bug inner monologue: a customer? Shoot bug, put on a smile. Time to put on your salesman pants.

Bug: HELLO MA'AM! YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A LOT OF VALD TO SPEND!

CAN I INTEREST YOU IN BULK SCRAP METAL AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE?

Ralphy: Sorry I have no interest in scrap metal. And I don't typically make deals with the devil.

BUG: HMM, HOW DID YOU GET THAT DEVILISHLY HANDSOME LOOKING REVOLVER THEN?

RALPHY: Some guy gave it to me. (Offended)

BUG: WELL RELAX, TOOTS. I MAY BE A DEVIL, BUT IM NOT *THE* DEVIL.

RALPHY: (annoyed) do you offer any services besides bulk scrap metal?

BUG: WELL I COULD FIX THAT GUN OF YOURS UP. YOU JUST NEED TO BRING ME SOME SPECIAL SCRAP METAL.  AND VALD FOR MY SERVICES OF COURSE.

RALPHY: Why do I need to bring you scrap metal when you have an abundance of it.

BUG: (monologuing again) oh cute, the angel girl thinks she knows more than the hard working demon who spent thousands of years studying, practicing, and refining the art of gunsmithing.

BUG: HAHA. UNFORTUNATELY THE SCRAP FOR THESE GUNS ARE KINDA SPECIAL AND NICHE... YOURE GONNA HAVE TO FIND THEM ON YOUR OWN.

RALPHY: Well great. I suppose I'll keep an eye out for scrap. Thanks, demon.

BUG: NO PROBLEM! ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE?
