Lived in [[Halcyona]] before stumbling on the [[Temple Of Redemption]]. He is a historian, and collects and identifies objects for [[Ralphy]]. He must wear a pig mask as punishment for all his days in purgatory.

Friends with [[Bug]], but is also kind of annoyed by his presence sometimes.


Optional Dialogue Cutscene 1:

[[Ralphy]]: So why exactly do you wear that mask? It looks uncomfortable.
Vincent: *Laughs*
Vincent (To Bug): "Hey Bug! Ralphy just asked by I "Choose" to wear this mask."
[[Bug]]: "HAHAHAHAHA"
Ralphy looks annoyed and confused
Vincent: Sorry.
Vincent: Unfortunately I dont have the comfort of being able to take my mask off.
Ralphy: Maybe I can help? *reaches for it*
Vincent backs away
Vincent: No! Dont touch!
Vincent: I cant take it off because it is part of my punishment.
Vincent: I've been wearing this thing since I got this body. And I intend to wear it as long as it takes for my redemption.
