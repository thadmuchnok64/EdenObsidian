Lived in [[Halcyona]] before stumbling on the [[Temple Of Redemption]]. He is a historian, and collects and identifies objects for [[Ralphy]]. He must wear a pig mask as punishment for all his days in purgatory.

Friends with [[Bug]], but is also kind of annoyed by his presence sometimes.

___
Ralphy is curious about this pig mask man. She wonders how he ended up in purgatory and not heaven.

Vincent wants to get on ralphy's good side so she can maybe help him get into heaven.

Vincent: Hello there. You must be Ralpheala. It's a great pleasure to meet you.
My name is Vincent.

Ralphy: Oh! Gael spoke about me?

Vincent. Oh yes. I've heard so much about you.

And I heard about your human too. You have my deepest condolences. 

Ralphy: Thanks. He really didn't do anything wrong though. This is all just one big misunderstanding.

Vincent: Oh I see. You're still in the denile phase.

Ralphy: what?

Vincent. Nothing. Look, if youre going to be hanging around the temple now, i think we could help eachother out.

I'm somewhat of a historian here. If you bring me artifacts, I might be able to figure out what they are.

It might seem silly, but humans in purgatory cherish their trinkets very much.

It reminds them of times of hope.

Optional Dialogue Cutscene 1:

[[Ralphy]]: So why exactly do you wear that mask? It looks uncomfortable.
Vincent: *Laughs*
Vincent (To Bug): "Hey Bug! Ralphy just asked by I "Choose" to wear this mask."
[[Bug]]: "HAHAHAHAHA"
Ralphy looks annoyed and confused
Vincent: Sorry.
Vincent: Unfortunately I dont have the comfort of being able to take my mask off.
Ralphy: Maybe I can help? *reaches for it*
Vincent backs away
Vincent: No! Dont touch!
Vincent: I cant take it off because it is part of my punishment.
Vincent: I've been wearing this thing since I got this body. And I intend to wear it as long as it takes for my redemption.
