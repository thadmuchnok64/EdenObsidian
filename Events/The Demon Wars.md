A period of time where [[Purgatory]] and [[Hell]] would skirmish. Caused a number of technological advancements, such as the invention of guns and gunpowder in the afterlife.

The demon wars were caused by Satan in order to cause as much suffering as possible for humans in purgatory, causing them to give up hope, and succumb to their innermost darkness, and eventually, fall to [[Hell]].

[[Heaven]] funded [[Purgatory]] by sending them angelic weapons, in order to keep the demons at bay. Many of these angelic weapons are still used and refurbished today by Purgatory residents.
