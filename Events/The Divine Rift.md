The event when [[The Temporal World|Humanity]] drifted away from [[God]]. This is tied directly to when Humanity started to leave it's hunter gatherer days and create civilizations. God viewed this as an act of rebellion and punished the humans for it. 

[[Satan]] took issue with God's punishment of the humans, and ended his friendship with God. As a result, God threw Satan into [[Hell]] along with his angels.

Humans were also able to enter hell depending on their innermost intentions.
